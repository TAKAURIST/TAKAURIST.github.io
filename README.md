  <p align="center">
    we do alot online, I made the takaurist project to see what more we can do. from management and security of our social media presence to what ever else this project expands to, I'll be looking through it all to see if I can make something worthwhile.

## WHAT IS THIS?
I'm using Github pages to make a temporary free website that I can redirect people to if they want to check out anything related to me.
speaking of which:
- my twitter [@takaurist](https://twitter.com/takaurist)
- my Github [TAKAURIST](https://github.com/TAKAURIST)

for now, I'm still in the set up phase for everything

## SOCKIT 
### (social-kit, also a pun on socket because you can plug SM's into it...)
[sockit](https://github.com/TAKAURIST/sockit) is going to be a PWA that will allow you to enter your gmail in and it will scan through, find and display the social media attached to it and allow you to customise the display however you want; mixing and matching filtered feeds from across each platform into a custom "board". creating content to post everywhere will also be a feature later on.
